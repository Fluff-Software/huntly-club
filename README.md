# Welcome to Huntly Club ðŸ‘‹

This is an Expo project, which uses Supabase for the back end.

## Get started with local development

1. Run Supabase locally

   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

2. Set up a .env file. You'll need to add details from your fresh running supabase project.

3. Install a development build on your device/simulator.

4. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

## Database

The core flow that we use to affect changes to the database and the associated types are:

1. Make changes to the database using the Supabase UI.

2. Create a migration file using

   ```bash
   supabase db diff --local
   ```

3. If needed, use this command to rebuild your database from the migrations:

   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

4. Recreate types using

   ```bash
   supabase gen types typescript --local > models/supabase.ts
   ```

5. Set up initial data:

   ```bash
   docker exec -i supabase_db_huntly-club psql -U postgres -d postgres < supabase/seed/initial_data.sql
   ```
